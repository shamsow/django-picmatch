# PicMatch

Histogram match a source picture to a reference picture using `scikit-image`

With this app, I set out to do three things:
- Mess around with skikit-image and get used to working with python libraries
- Get more proficient at using Bootstrap instead of hacking together CSS to fit my needs
- Familiarise myself with the mechanics of working with file upload/download in Django

I do feel like I succeeded at all three.
